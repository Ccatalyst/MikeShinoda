                Mike Shinoda has put out a variety of great music over the years, from his time in Linkin Park and heading 
                Fort Minor to his independant albums and lofi instrumental tracks. Mike Shinoda is also a big fan of video games,
                and shares his video game love on his <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeshinoda?s=20" target="_blank"> Twitter</a>. Recently 
                his love of video games has been tainted by the foul stench of

                Why are NFTs a problem?
            </h2>
                <p>
                    NFTs have a plethora of problems:
                    <li>The energy used to "mint" an NFT is high, causing huge draws on power grids in various countries, causing shortages and blackouts.</li>
                    <li>The desire for hardware used to creat the blockchain for NFTs has created shortages in the market</li>
                    <li>Because it is purchased using anonymous currency, scams and thefts are prevalent</li>
